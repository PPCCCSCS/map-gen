I have this running in pygame, but the algorithm will work anywhere you can read and write individual pixels (or other graphical elements)
-- I got it to work (SLOWLY) with the turtle library, and I'm pretty sure it would work in Excel if that were necessary, but eh.

For more complex maps, add more lists to cartos in line 84, and increase the screenWidth and screenHeight global variables as desired.

Do not run while operating heavy machinery.
